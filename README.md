👉 **[NeuroScanAI on Vercel](http://neuroscanai-theta.vercel.app)**

💡 Features:

-🏥 Analyze brain MRI scans for Alzheimer's disease indicators
-⚡ Fast and intuitive web interface
-📊 Visualization of predictions
-🧬 Modular design (frontend & backend separated)
-💻 Deployed and accessible online

🛠️ Tech Stack:

-**Python** (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy etc.)
-**Flask** (Backend server)
-**React.js** (Frontend)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Vercel** (Deployment)

⚙️ Setup and Installation:

``` bash 
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/eshanvijay/NeuroScanAI.git
cd NeuroScanAI

# Navigate to backend
cd server

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start backend server
python app.py

# In a new terminal, navigate to client
cd ../client

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend
npm start

⚠️ Note on model files
💡 Important:
The trained model file (model.h5) is too large to include directly on GitHub (over 100 MB).

If you'd like to test the model locally, please DM me directly, and I will share the file (Google Drive link or other preferred method).
``` ``` ```

🎥 Demo
A working demo video showcasing the app in action will be added here soon! 🔥
